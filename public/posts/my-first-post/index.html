<p>This site started from the <a href="https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/">hugo quick start</a>.</p>
<p>Not going into each prerequisite. You can follow the links to the installation instructions.</p>
<p>The long and short of the process is to install hugo, then run commands to:</p>
<ol>
<li>create the site</li>
<li>add conent</li>
<li>preview</li>
<li>publish</li>
</ol>
<p>The next step would be to deploy the site. <a href="https://gohugo.io/hosting-and-deployment/hosting-on-github/">Github Pages</a> would be my prefered choice.</p>
<p>My next post, hopefully will be the deployed version of this site.</p>
<p>I hope to have some more posts about using Hugo.<br>

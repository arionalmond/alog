Arion of Corinth

Arion of Corinth was a renowned Greek lyric poet and musician active in the late 7th century BC. He was born in Methymna, on the island of Lesbos, and lived most of his life at the court of Periander, the tyrant of Corinth. Arion was known for his exceptional skill with the lyre and his contributions to the development of the dithyramb, a choral hymn in honor of Dionysus, although the exact nature of his contributions is debated.  

Arion made a journey to Sicily and southern Italy, where he participated in music competitions and won numerous prizes, earning a significant amount of money and valuable gifts. On his return trip to Corinth, the sailors of his ship plotted to kill him and seize his treasures. Arion, aware of their intentions, requested to sing one last song before jumping into the sea. His performance attracted a school of dolphins, and he was rescued by one of them, which carried him safely back to Corinth.  

Upon his return, Arion exposed the sailors' plot to Periander, who punished the sailors and recovered Arion's stolen wealth. This miraculous rescue by a dolphin became a well-known story among both the Corinthians and the Lesbians.  

Arion is also credited with introducing the dithyramb to Corinth and possibly reforming its performance style, though the exact details of his contributions to the dithyramb are uncertain.

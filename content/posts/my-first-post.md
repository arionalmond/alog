## Hugo Quickstart

I love [go](https://go.dev/). Why I love it, will be another post.  
Hugo is open-source and built with go. Check out the [project on github](https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo).

The [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) website states:    
> Hugo is the worldâ€™s fastest framework for building websites.  
Hugo is one of the most popular open-source static site generators.  
With its amazing speed and flexibility, Hugo makes building websites fun again.  

We shall see!  

This site started from the [hugo quick start](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/quick-start/).    

Not going into each prerequisite. You can follow the links to the installation instructions.  

The long and short of the process is to install hugo, then run commands to:    
1. create the site
2. add conent
3. preview
4. publish

The next step would be to deploy the site. [Github Pages](https://gohugo.io/hosting-and-deployment/hosting-on-github/) would be my prefered choice.  

My next post, hopefully will be the deployed version of this site.  

I hope to have some more posts about using Hugo.  
For a quick overview checkout [Hugo in 100 Seconds](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0RKpf3rK57I).
